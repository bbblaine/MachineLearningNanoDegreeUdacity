    "1.Three model:Support Vector Machine(SVM),Bayesian Network, Boosting\n",
    "2.General Application:\n",
    "A.SVM can be used as classification and regression. when using it to do classification, examples of seperate categories are divided into clear gap, where gap as wide as possible;\n",
    "B.Bayesian Network is a probabilistic graphical model that represent variables and that dependencies though graph.it can representation of joint distribution, and used to classification based on the possibility.\n",
    "C.Boosting can be used to improve the accuracy of any learning model as long as they are 'weak learners'.\n",
    "Strenghts and Weakness:\n",
    "A.SVM: strength: it can performance well where clear margin of seperation in complex domain. when doing classification, it will get maximum possible margin, so that it can have good accuracy and more confidence; weakness: it is slow in training large dataset, and not so well in dataset with lots of noise; what's more, SVM is a binary classifier. we had to use one Vs all to do classification. so it means we had to do classification for serveral times before we can get result for mulit-class classification.\n",
    "B.Bayesian Network: strength: it is export in calucate possibility with the help of naive bayes; with graphical model it is cheap to calucate possibility, and get result of classification based on possibility. weakness: it assume that attributes are independent. but in really, it maybe not true. if an attribute haven't seen a label, it may result of zero possibility, which may give wrong singal.\n",
    "C.Boosting: strength: it can be used to apply for many models, and help to improve accuracy. and it usually will not have overfitting.\n",
    "weakness: weak learner like neural network with many layers, which may already have overfitting,it will also result of overfitting.\n",
    "3.Why choose these three models:\n",
    "other models like Neural Network, Decision Tree, Instance Based Learning, can also be used to performance classification. but i choose above three models, because i know that they are powerful to do classification. and i want to apply them in real problem, so that i can not only understand the principle, but also have hand on experience of use them, and evalution their performances.\n",

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",
    "- Fit each model with each training set size and make predictions on the test set (9 in total).  \n",
    "**Note:** Three tables are provided after the following code cell which can be used to store your results."
